# Case-CSIT

Digital project studies. 
Commission: Self-service portal

The purpose of the assignment was for groups to implement a prototype of a "Self-Service Portal" for end users of CSIT Finland OY's IDM (Identity Management) software.

Front End progamming was recommended. 

Our prototype can be found at https://7be1ha.axshare.com

Front End code is in this GitHub repository. Made with React.js.  

Unfornately the time allotted for this course did not allow for us to completelty finish. The next steps would be to
1. connect to an actual backend (now runs on json server)
2. move top banner to it's own component
3. make sure that "Kirjaudu ulos" is shown only when logged in
4. add updating user's info (front & back communicating)

and so on.
